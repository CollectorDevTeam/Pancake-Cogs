# Pancake-Cogs
Messing around with Python, because it's fun and it takes my mind off of Java (blegh...).

**Made these cogs with my own server in mind and cannot guarantee they will work.**

**These are also pretty much just simple joke cogs to entertain friends. Not meant to be taken too seriously as a development effort.**

If reported though, I will try my best to fix it for you... when I have time.
